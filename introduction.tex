\chapter{Introduction}

``Mental pictures'' and ``visual intuition'' capture how people make sense of abstract concepts and see solutions to hard problems in a visual way. Hadamard described numerous examples of mathematicians doing exactly this in \emph{The Mathematician's Mind}~\cite{Hadamard1997a}, later summarized by Alan Kay~\cite{doingWithImages}:

\begin{quote}
Jacques Hadamard, the famous French mathematician, in the late stages of his life, decided to poll his 99 buddies, who made up together the 100 great mathematicians and physicists on the earth, and he asked them, ``How do you do your thing?'' They were all personal friends of his, so they wrote back depositions. Only a few, out of the hundred, claimed to use mathematical symbology at all. Quite a surprise. All of them said they did it mostly in imagery or figurative terms.
\end{quote}

Learning research suggests that visual representations of knowledge are powerful tools for thought. Visual representations like diagrams enable more robust learning \cite{multimediaLearning} and abstract and flexible problem solving~\cite{Koedinger1990a, pictureAlgebra, DiagramsThousandWords}. Importantly, when people work with visuals, they build better conceptual understanding and more flexible mental models that go beyond memorized procedures~\cite{multipleReps}.

Let me use a diagram to capture this: the \textbf{grounding rectangle} represents two pathways to learning and problem solving: One can perform symbol-to-symbol transformations (SS, or “symbol pushing”) or through an \textcolor[HTML]{8C91C2}{alternative diagrammatic pathway}: a symbol-to-diagram translation (SV), a diagram-to-diagram transformation (VV), and finally a diagram-to-symbol translation (VS).

Research on expertise development suggests a need for substantial exposure involving repetition in varied contexts or deliberate practice \cite{deliberatePractice} to acquire the perceptual chunks \cite{chunkingModels, perceptualLearningExpertise} that support accurate interpretation and use of visual representations~\cite{Koedinger1990a}. Through enough practice, learning the two paths in the grounding rectangle can produce better, more robust memory \cite{dualCoding}, learning~\cite{multipleReps, multimediaLearning, cotraining}, and future reasoning, both in providing flexibility and in supporting error recovery \cite{groundedAndAbstractReps}.

In reality, there seems to be an over-abundance of symbolic practice, continuing Kay's train of thought:

\begin{quote}
    The sad part of the diagram is that every child in the United States is taught math and physics through this [symbolic] channel. The channel that almost no adult creative mathematician or physicist uses to do it... They use this channel to communicate, but not to do their thing.
\end{quote}

Diagrammatic practice is rare due to the significant cost of authoring diagrammatic problems. Existing diagramming tools often require hours of low-level tweaking of geometric primitives and do not capture the core task of diagramming: representing ideas visually. In other words, these tools lack \emph{representational salience}. As a result, the diagrams created by existing tools don't have semantics, as they are merely a collection of pixels and geometric blobs.  

% In prior work, colleagues and I built \Penrose, a diagramming platform that explicitly encodes visual representations in domain-specific languages (DSLs)~\cite{penrose}. In this thesis proposal, I argue that this explicit encoding can be leveraged to (1) reduce the programming effort of producing diagrammatic problems at scale and (2) simplify the workflow of authoring interactive diagrams. The resulting diagrams also carry rich semantics, and I propose to use them to (3) provide useful, automated feedback to students. My thesis statement summarizes the above:

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item \emph{Need-finding studies} on challenges authors face.
%     \item \emph{A platform of tools} based on the visual encoding of \Penrose for mass-production of diagrams (\cref{chp:edgeworth}) and rapid authoring of interactive diagrams (\cref{chp:ipenrose}).
%     \item \emph{A theoretical framework} of the grounding rectangle, which guides the design of tools presented in this proposal.
