Trigonometric identities are often presented as a big list of rules.

\noindent Students are often asked to solve problems by applying a subset of those rules, \eg, $sin(0 - \theta) = -sin(\theta)$.

A useful visual representation of this concept is the unit circle: on a Cartesian plane with a circle of radius $1$ centered at the origin, concrete values of trig functions are represented visually and rules are implicitly encoded as geometric transformations. For instance, the value of $sin(\theta)$ is the y-coordinate of a point on the circle, where the ray from the origin to the point forms angle $\theta$ with the x-axis.

To derive the identity rule visually, one only needs to note that $-\theta$ is a reflection about the x-axis, and observe that the y-coordinate is now a negative number. Instead of having to memorize a big set of rules, one can reduce this problem to a simple operation on the visual representation of a unit circle.

By translating the symbols to a visual representation, a unit circle, a student completely bypasses the tedious memorization of trig identities. While this is a much more retainable and robust representation for students, are we teaching representations like this to students? What does it take for students to internalize it?
